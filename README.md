## Hi 👋

My name is Endrick, I am a behavioral scientist with a background in psychology and biology (bachelor's degree in biology from UFBA), and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in ecology, also at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA).

I am part of the NuEVo laboratory (Nucleus for Ethology and Evolution), where I conduct research on Social Behavior and Sociobiology based on the theories of Behaviorism and Biological Autonomy.

I am currently programming in Python, R, Julia and Bash, applying them to statistics focused on Social Behavior, Sociobiology and also contributing to the GNU/Linux community.
