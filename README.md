## Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Endrick, I am a Behavioral Scientist with a background in Psychology. I am currently an undergraduate student in Biology and a Master's student in Ecology, both at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA).

I am part of the NuEVo laboratory (Nucleus for Ethology and Evolution), where I conduct research on Social Behavior based on the theories of Behaviorism and Biological Autonomy.

I am currently programming in Julia, Python, and Bash, applying them to statistics focused on Social Behavior and also contributing to the GNU/Linux community.
